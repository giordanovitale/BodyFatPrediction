Remove Density.
```{r}
bodyfat <- bodyfat %>%
  select(-Density)
```

Create ACratio and HTratio
```{r}
bodyfat$ACratio <- bodyfat$Abdomen / bodyfat$Chest
bodyfat$HTratio <- bodyfat$Hip / bodyfat$Thigh
```

Remove Abdomen, Chest, Hip, Thigh since we created new variables. 
Why? Because of high collinearity.
```{r}
bodyfat <- bodyfat %>% 
  select(-Abdomen, -Chest, -Hip, -Thigh)
```

```{r}
head(bodyfat)
```
