To upload a file to a GitHub repository, you need to perform both a commit and a push. 
The commit records the changes you made to the local repository, while the push sends those committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub.



Here are the steps you should follow:
 1. Make changes to the file in your R project.
 2. Save the changes in the file.
 3. Open the version control panel or window in your R IDE (e.g., RStudio).
 4. Stage the changes: Select the file you want to upload and click on the "Stage" or "Add" button in the version control  panel. This will prepare the file for the commit.
 5. Commit the changes: Provide a commit message describing the changes you made and click on the "Commit" button. This  will commit the changes to your local repository.
 6. Push the changes: After committing the changes, you need to push them to the remote repository on GitHub. In the  version control panel, click on the "Push" button. This will send the committed changes to GitHub.







If you have followed these steps and the GitHub repository didn't update, there might be a few reasons:
 1. Check your internet connection: Ensure that you have a stable internet connection to push changes to the remote repository.
 2. Verify repository credentials: Make sure you are using the correct GitHub account credentials that have access to the repository.
 3. Double-check the branch: Ensure that you are pushing to the correct branch of the repository. By default, it is often the "main" branch.
 4. Pull changes from remote (if necessary): If there have been changes made in the remote repository after your last pull, you may need to pull those changes to your local repository first before pushing your changes.
 5. Check for errors or messages: Pay attention to any error messages or notifications that might appear during the push process. They can provide valuable information about what might be causing the issue.
